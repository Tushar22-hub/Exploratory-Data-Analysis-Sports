# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-Sports

Here I have created the EDA model of the IPL dataset :

● Performed ‘Exploratory Data Analysis’ on dataset ‘Indian Premier League’

● I found out the most successful teams, players and factors contributing win or loss of a team.

● Suggested teams or players a company should endorse for its products.

● I used Python as language to perform the functions.
